# Belief Revision Assignment

This is the implementation of a belief revision engine for the belief revision assignment
This implementation is written in Python and has been tested using Python 3.12

The belief engine can be tested both as a program prompting a user for input or by running three test scripts. The three test scripts all initalize and empty belief base and revises the belief base for multiple inputs. Both approaches are defined below: 

## Running the program

Starting the 

``` python3 main.py ```


## Run test scripts

Starting each of the three test scripts can be done by: which revises a belief base for multiple inputs

``` python3 test_script_1.py ```
``` python3 test_script_2.py ```
``` python3 test_script_3.py ```
